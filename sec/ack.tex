This report is prepared for the partial fulfillment of the course {\em Object
Oriented Analysis and Design} of the 6th semester of Bachelors in Computer
Engineering. Best efforts have been made to ensure that this report is
accurate and professional as far as possible.

We are very grateful to our subject teacher {\bf Dr.~Arun~Kumar~Timalsina~Sir}, for his
excellent lectures and tutorials that helped us become familiar with the
terminologies and concepts in object oriented approach in software development.

We would also like to thank the Department of Electronics and Computer
Engineering (DoECE) of Central Campus Pulchowk, Institute of Engineering for
providing us with this great opportunity to develop a project on the very
interesting course of Object Oriented Analysis and Design. This project has
greatly enhanced our knowledge of object oriented framework in software
development.
