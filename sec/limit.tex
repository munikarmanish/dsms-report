\section{Limitations and Future Enhancements}

Some limitations of our current applications are:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
  \item The system is not designed to be operated by multiple cashiers at the
    same time.
  \item No automated system to notify when the stock of product is less than
    the threshold.
  \item Once the bill is made and committed, the system does not validate the
    confirmation of bill payment.
  \item The system cannot keep the track of Cash Inflow and Outflow of store
    yet.
  \item Bill printing feature isn't available yet.
\end{itemize}

Future enhancements:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
  \item Staff login system will be added.
  \item A robust transaction handler system will be implemented.
  \item User Interface will be improved.
  \item Bill print feature will be added.
\end{itemize}
